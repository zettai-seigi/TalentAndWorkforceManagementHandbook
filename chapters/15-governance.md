## The Need for Workforce Governance

Talent and workforce management governance provides the structures, processes, and controls necessary to ensure that human capital decisions are made consistently, ethically, and in alignment with organizational objectives. Without governance, workforce practices vary across departments, compliance risks increase, and strategic talent objectives are not achieved.

Effective workforce governance serves multiple critical purposes:

**Strategic Alignment**: Ensures workforce decisions support organizational strategy and business objectives

**Risk Mitigation**: Identifies and manages risks related to talent acquisition, development, and retention

**Compliance Assurance**: Maintains adherence to employment laws, regulations, and organizational policies

**Accountability**: Establishes clear ownership for workforce outcomes and decisions

**Consistency**: Ensures equitable treatment of employees across the organization

**Continuous Improvement**: Enables learning and advancement of workforce management practices

        |
Enterprise Governance
        |
        ├── Executive Leadership Team
