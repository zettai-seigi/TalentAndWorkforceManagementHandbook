# Chapter 15: Governance Framework and Controls

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Establish workforce governance structures and oversight bodies

## The Need for Workforce Governance

Talent and workforce management governance provides the structures, processes, and controls necessary to ensure that human capital decisions are made consistently, ethically, and in alignment with organizational objectives. Without governance, workforce practices vary across departments, compliance risks increase, and strategic talent objectives are not achieved.

Effective workforce governance serves multiple critical purposes:

**Strategic Alignment**: Ensures workforce decisions support organizational strategy and business objectives

**Risk Mitigation**: Identifies and manages risks related to talent acquisition, development, and retention

**Compliance Assurance**: Maintains adherence to employment laws, regulations, and organizational policies

**Accountability**: Establishes clear ownership for workforce outcomes and decisions

**Consistency**: Ensures equitable treatment of employees across the organization

**Continuous Improvement**: Enables learning and advancement of workforce management practices

- Quarterly risk dashboard updates

*Risk Identification Techniques*:
- Brainstorming sessions with diverse participants
- SWOT analysis of workforce function
- Scenario analysis of potential future states
- Benchmarking against peer organizations
- Review of industry risk frameworks
- Analysis of near-miss incidents

**Step 2: Risk Analysis and Assessment**

For each identified risk:

1. *Describe the Risk*:
   - Clear risk statement (event and consequence)
   - Root causes and contributing factors
   - Current state assessment
   - Historical incidents (if any)

2. *Assess Likelihood*:
   - Historical frequency of similar events
   - Current control environment
   - Industry benchmarks
   - Expert judgment
   - Likelihood rating (1-5)

3. *Assess Impact*:
   - Financial impact potential
   - Operational impact
   - Compliance and legal consequences
   - Reputational damage potential
   - Impact rating (1-5)

4. *Calculate Risk Rating*:
   - Risk rating = Likelihood × Impact
   - Plot on risk matrix
   - Categorize as critical, high, medium, or low

5. *Assess Risk Velocity*:
   - Speed at which risk could materialize
   - Time available for response
   - Classification: Rapid (days), Moderate (weeks-months), Slow (months-years)

**Step 3: Risk Prioritization**

*Prioritization Criteria*:
- Risk rating (primary factor)
- Risk velocity (rapid risks prioritized)
- Regulatory or compliance mandates
- Board or executive priority
- Cost-effectiveness of mitigation
- Interdependencies with other risks

*Portfolio View*:
- Aggregate view of all workforce risks
- Risk concentration analysis
- Risk interdependencies identified
- Resource allocation to mitigation efforts

**Step 4: Risk Mitigation Strategy Development**

For each priority risk, develop comprehensive mitigation strategy:

*Risk Response Options*:

1. **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk by not engaging in the activity
   - Example: Avoid co-employment risk by using only W-2 employees

2. **Mitigate**: Reduce likelihood or impact through controls
   - Example: Reduce compliance risk through training and audits

3. **Transfer**: Shift risk to third party
   - Example: Transfer liability through insurance or outsourcing

4. **Accept**: Acknowledge risk and monitor
   - Example: Accept minor turnover risk in non-critical roles

*Mitigation Strategy Components*:
- Specific actions to reduce likelihood or impact
- Control implementation plan
- Accountability and ownership
- Timeline and milestones
- Resource requirements
- Success metrics

*Compensating Controls*:
When primary controls are not feasible, design compensating controls:
- Detective controls when preventive not possible
- Manual reviews when system controls unavailable
- Increased frequency of monitoring
- Enhanced documentation requirements

**Step 5: Risk Monitoring and Reporting**

*Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)*:

Establish leading indicators that provide early warning of increasing risk:

## Expanded Controls Framework

### Control Objective Framework

Controls are organized by objective to ensure comprehensive coverage:

**Strategic Controls**:
- Workforce strategy aligns with business strategy
- Workforce investments deliver expected returns
- Talent risks are identified and managed
- Governance provides appropriate oversight

**Operational Controls**:
- Workforce processes operate effectively and efficiently
- Quality standards are met in talent management
- Service levels are achieved for workforce services
- Productivity and performance are optimized

**Compliance Controls**:
- Employment laws and regulations are followed
- Policies are implemented consistently
- Required documentation is maintained
- Reporting requirements are met

**Financial Controls**:
- Workforce costs are within budget
- Financial transactions are authorized
- Compensation and payroll are accurate
- Financial reporting is reliable

**Information Controls**:
- Workforce data is accurate and complete
- Data privacy and security are maintained
- Information access is controlled
- Technology risks are managed

### Preventive vs. Detective Controls

Understanding control types enables effective control design:

**Preventive Controls**:

Preventive controls stop errors or violations before they occur:

*Examples*:
- System controls enforcing required fields
- Approval workflows requiring authorization before action
- Segregation of duties preventing single-person completion
- Access controls restricting unauthorized users
- Training preventing unintentional non-compliance
- Policies establishing clear requirements

*Strengths*:
- Prevent issues from occurring
- More cost-effective than detection and correction
- Reduce risk exposure
- Improve quality and consistency

*Limitations*:
- May not catch all errors
- Can be circumvented if not designed properly
- May create operational inefficiency if overly restrictive

**Detective Controls**:

Detective controls identify errors or violations after they occur:

*Examples*:
- Reconciliations identifying discrepancies
- Exception reports highlighting out-of-policy transactions
- Audits reviewing compliance with requirements
- Monitoring dashboards showing metrics
- Review and approval of completed work
- Analytics identifying patterns or anomalies

*Strengths*:
- Catch errors that bypass preventive controls
- Identify control failures for remediation
- Provide evidence of control operating
- Enable root cause analysis

*Limitations*:
- Reactive rather than proactive
- Issue has already occurred
- May discover issue too late for effective response
- Require resource investment in monitoring

**Compensating Controls**:

When ideal controls are not feasible, compensating controls provide alternative risk mitigation:

*Scenarios Requiring Compensating Controls*:
- System limitations prevent automated control
- Cost of primary control exceeds benefit
- Operational requirements conflict with ideal control
- Small team size prevents full segregation of duties

*Compensating Control Examples*:
- Manual review compensating for lack of system control
- Increased monitoring frequency compensating for weaker preventive control
- Enhanced documentation compensating for limited segregation of duties
- Third-party review compensating for internal resource limitations

*Compensating Control Requirements*:
- Document why primary control not feasible
- Design compensating control to achieve same objective
- Assess effectiveness of compensating control
- Monitor compensating control operation
- Plan for implementing primary control when feasible

### Control Testing Procedures

Regular testing validates that controls operate effectively:

**Control Testing Approach**:

*Testing Frequency*:
- Critical controls: Quarterly testing
- High-risk controls: Semi-annual testing
- Standard controls: Annual testing
- Low-risk controls: Biennial testing

*Sampling Methodology*:
- Statistical sampling for large populations
- Risk-based sampling targeting higher-risk items
- Judgmental sampling for specific concerns
- 100% testing for critical, low-volume controls

**Testing Procedures by Control Type**:

*System-Enforced Controls*:
1. Review system configuration documentation
2. Attempt to perform prohibited transaction
3. Verify system prevents or flags the transaction
4. Test for bypass mechanisms
5. Review exception handling process
6. Verify logging and monitoring

*Approval Controls*:
1. Select sample of transactions requiring approval
2. Verify approval was obtained before action taken
3. Confirm approver had appropriate authority
4. Assess timeliness of approval
5. Review approval documentation quality
6. Test for approval bypassing

*Segregation of Duties Controls*:
1. Obtain list of users with access to incompatible functions
2. Review user access reports for violations
3. Test sample of transactions for proper segregation
4. Interview personnel about role responsibilities
5. Verify compensating controls where segregation not possible
6. Review exception access and monitoring

*Data Integrity Controls*:
1. Select sample of data elements to test
2. Trace data from source to system
3. Verify data accuracy and completeness
4. Test data validation rules
5. Review error handling and correction
6. Assess data quality metrics

**Control Testing Documentation**:

*Testing Workpapers*:
- Control description and objective
- Testing procedures performed
- Sample selection methodology
- Detailed test results
- Exceptions identified
- Root cause analysis of exceptions
- Conclusion on control effectiveness

*Control Effectiveness Ratings*:
- **Effective**: Control operating as designed with no significant exceptions
- **Effective with Exceptions**: Control generally effective but minor exceptions noted
- **Ineffective**: Control not operating as designed or significant exceptions

### Control Remediation Process

When control deficiencies are identified, structured remediation is required:

**Deficiency Assessment**:

*Deficiency Severity Levels*:

**Material Weakness**:
- Reasonable possibility material misstatement would not be prevented or detected
- Requires immediate remediation and CEO/CFO disclosure (for SOX)
- Escalation to board audit committee

**Significant Deficiency**:
- Less severe than material weakness but important enough to merit attention
- Requires executive management attention
- Reported to audit committee

**Control Deficiency**:
- Control not designed or operating effectively
- Does not rise to significant deficiency level
- Managed through normal remediation process

**Remediation Planning**:

*Remediation Action Plan*:
1. Root cause analysis of deficiency
2. Corrective actions to remediate deficiency
3. Preventive actions to prevent recurrence
4. Action owners and accountability
5. Timeline and milestones
6. Resource requirements
7. Success metrics

*Action Plan Approval*:
- Control owner develops plan
- HR leadership reviews and approves
- CHRO signs off on plan
- Governance committee approves (for significant deficiencies)

**Remediation Implementation**:

*Implementation Steps*:
1. Communicate plan to stakeholders
2. Allocate resources for remediation
3. Execute corrective actions
4. Monitor progress against milestones
5. Escalate delays or issues
6. Document remediation activities
7. Test remediated control
8. Obtain validation of effectiveness

*Progress Monitoring*:

- Bi-weekly updates for significant deficiencies
- Monthly updates for control deficiencies
- Escalation for overdue remediation

**Remediation Validation**:

*Validation Process*:
1. Internal testing of remediated control
2. Documentation of test results
3. Review by independent party (internal audit)
4. External auditor validation (if SOX control)
5. Sign-off by appropriate governance level
6. Ongoing monitoring to ensure sustainability

## Data Governance for HR

### HR Data Classification

Proper classification enables appropriate protection:

**Classification Levels**:

| Classification | Definition | Examples | Access | Handling Requirements |
|----------------|------------|----------|--------|----------------------|
| Public | Information intended for public disclosure | Job postings, company benefits summary | Anyone | Standard document handling |
| Internal | Information for internal use, no significant harm if disclosed | Internal policies, org charts, general employee directory | Employees | Internal systems, email encryption optional |
| Confidential | Sensitive information, moderate harm if disclosed | Individual salaries, performance ratings, personal contact information | Need-to-know basis, HR, management | Encrypted transmission, secure storage, access logging |
| Highly Confidential | Very sensitive information, significant harm if disclosed | SSN, medical information, background checks, investigations | Strictly limited, designated personnel only | Encrypted transmission and storage, access controls, detailed logging, physical security |
| Restricted | Information subject to legal or regulatory protection | Medical records (HIPAA), EU employee data (GDPR), credit reports | Minimal necessary access | Strictest controls, segregated systems, comprehensive logging, incident response plan |

**Classification Guidelines**:

*Individually Identifiable Information*:
- Information that can identify a specific individual
- Requires confidential or higher classification
- Subject to privacy laws and regulations

*Aggregated Anonymous Information*:
- Data aggregated such that individuals cannot be identified

- More granular than role-based
- Enables dynamic access decisions

*Access Request and Approval*:
1. User requests access through standard process
2. Manager approves business need
3. Data owner approves access to their data domain
4. IT security validates and implements access
5. Access logged in access management system
6. User receives access notification and training

*Access Recertification*:
- Quarterly review of high-privilege access
- Annual review of all access
- Managers attest to appropriateness of direct report access
- Automated removal of access to terminated employees
- Prompt access changes for role changes

### Data Retention Requirements

Balancing legal requirements, business needs, and privacy principles:

**Retention Schedule**:

## Summary

Comprehensive governance framework and controls provide the foundation for effective, compliant, and strategic workforce management. This chapter presents an integrated approach to workforce governance that spans framework design, governance structures, policy management, risk management, compliance, controls, data governance, and vendor governance.

The **governance framework design** establishes the foundation with the three lines of defense model, governance maturity model, operating model, and stakeholder roles. Organizations can assess their current maturity level and plan progression toward leading practices that integrate workforce governance with enterprise governance.

**Governance structures** include the Workforce Governance Committee at the executive level with clear charter, decision authority, meeting cadence, and effectiveness metrics. Supporting structures include the Talent Management Council, Compensation Committee, HR Compliance Council, and Workforce Analytics Board, each with defined purpose, composition, and responsibilities. Clear integration with board-level committees ensures appropriate escalation and oversight.

**Policy governance** encompasses the complete policy lifecycle from development through review and update. A structured policy exception process provides flexibility while maintaining governance through risk-based approvals and comprehensive tracking. Compliance monitoring uses automated and manual approaches to ensure policies are followed, with structured audit procedures providing independent assessment and remediation of findings.

**Risk management framework** applies a comprehensive taxonomy organizing workforce risks into strategic, operational, compliance, financial, and reputational categories. A structured risk assessment methodology ensures consistent evaluation of likelihood and impact with clear prioritization. Key risk indicators provide early warning of increasing risk, while mitigation strategies address critical risks through preventive, detective, and contingency approaches. The risk reporting framework ensures appropriate communication to all governance levels.

**Compliance framework** addresses the complex landscape of employment laws at federal, state, local, and international levels. The employment law compliance matrix provides a comprehensive view of requirements and compliance activities. International compliance considerations address region-specific requirements including GDPR in Europe. Structured audit preparation and response processes enable effective management of regulatory audits. Regulatory change management ensures timely implementation of new requirements through systematic monitoring and implementation processes.

**Expanded controls framework** organizes controls by objective—strategic, operational, compliance, financial, and information. Understanding of preventive versus detective controls enables effective control design, with compensating controls providing alternative mitigation when ideal controls are not feasible. Regular control testing validates effectiveness, while structured remediation processes address deficiencies. For public companies, specific controls and documentation address SOX requirements for financial reporting.

**Data governance for HR** starts with data classification enabling appropriate protection based on sensitivity. Data quality management ensures accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, and validity through defined roles, processes, and metrics. Data access controls protect sensitive information through least privilege and role-based access with regular recertification. Data retention requirements balance legal obligations with privacy principles. Privacy compliance addresses GDPR, CCPA, and global requirements through structured programs including privacy notices, data subject rights, and breach response.

**Vendor governance** ensures workforce technology and services vendors deliver expected value. Systematic vendor selection uses defined criteria evaluating functional fit, technical capabilities, implementation approach, and pricing. Vendor performance management monitors delivery through SLAs, KPIs, and regular business reviews with tiered governance based on vendor criticality. Proactive vendor risk assessment identifies and mitigates operational, financial, compliance, and strategic risks. Effective contract management protects the organization through clear terms, centralized repository, and structured renewal processes.

Effective workforce governance balances oversight with empowerment—providing sufficient structure to ensure consistency and compliance while enabling managers and HR professionals to make timely decisions that support business objectives. The frameworks, structures, processes, and controls presented in this chapter enable organizations to build mature workforce governance that manages risk, ensures compliance, protects data, and enables strategic workforce management.
