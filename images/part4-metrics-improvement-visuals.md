### Visual 13-Figure-13.3: Data Visualization Best Practices Guide

**Visual ID**: 13-Figure-13.3

**Type**: Reference Guide / Good vs. Bad Examples

**Title**: Data Visualization Best Practices for Workforce Metrics

**Chapter Reference**: Chapter 13: Reporting and Analytics, Section "Data Visualization Best Practices"

**Purpose**: Provide a visual reference guide showing effective vs. ineffective data visualization techniques with before/after examples using workforce data.

**Content Description**:
- Six common visualization mistakes with corrections
- Side-by-side "before" (bad) and "after" (good) examples
- Explanation of what's wrong and why the fix works
- Chart type selection guidance

**Six Examples**:

---

**Example 1: Choose the Right Chart Type**

**❌ BEFORE: 3D Pie Chart (BAD)**
```
[3D pie chart showing turnover by department]
- 6 slices with 3D effect
- Hard to compare slice sizes
- Perspective distorts values
- Decorative, not functional
```

**Problem**:
- 3D distorts perception of values
- Hard to compare multiple categories
- Angles make small differences invisible
- Generally discouraged for serious analysis

**✅ AFTER: Horizontal Bar Chart (GOOD)**
```
Turnover by Department (FY 2024)

Engineering       ████████████░ 15.2%
Sales             ██████████░░░ 12.8%
Marketing         ████████░░░░░ 10.5%
Product           ███████░░░░░░  9.2%
Customer Success  ██████░░░░░░░  8.1%
Finance           ████░░░░░░░░░  5.3%

Company Average: 10.2%
```

**Why It Works**:
✓ Easy to compare values
✓ Precise reading of percentages
✓ Can show company average line
✓ Sorted by value (highest first)
✓ Clean and professional

**Example 2: Avoid Chartjunk and Unnecessary Decoration**

**❌ BEFORE: Over-Decorated Dashboard (BAD)**
```
[Dashboard with]
- Heavy gradients and shadows
- 3D effects on all charts
- Decorative icons everywhere
- Multiple fonts and colors
- Busy background patterns
- Animated elements
```

**Problem**:
- Visual noise distracts from data
- Hard to focus on insights
- Looks unprofessional
- Reduces readability
- Increases cognitive load

**✅ AFTER: Clean, Minimal Design (GOOD)**
```
Hiring Metrics Q4 2024

Total Hires: 42
Time to Fill: 38 days ↓
Offer Acceptance: 85% ↑

[Clean bar chart with single color]
[Simple line chart with one accent color]
[Minimal grid lines]
[White background]
```

**Why It Works**:
✓ Focus on data, not decoration
✓ High signal-to-noise ratio
✓ Professional appearance
✓ Faster comprehension
✓ Print-friendly

**Guideline**: "Data-ink ratio should be maximized. Remove anything that doesn't convey information."

---

**Example 3: Use Appropriate Scales and Axes**

**❌ BEFORE: Truncated Y-Axis (MISLEADING)**
```
Performance Ratings Trend
5.0 ┤              ╱
4.8 ┤          ╱
4.6 ┤      ╱
4.4 ┤  ╱
4.2 └────────────────
    Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4
```
Average: 4.5 → 4.7 (looks like massive improvement)

**Problem**:
- Truncated axis exaggerates change
- Actual change is only 0.2 points (4.4%)
- Misleading visual impression
- Can manipulate perception

**✅ AFTER: Zero-Based Y-Axis (ACCURATE)**
```
Performance Ratings Trend
5.0 ┤________________
4.0 ┤________________
3.0 ┤________________
2.0 ┤________________
1.0 ┤________________
0.0 └────────────────
    Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4
```
Average: 4.5 → 4.7 (small, steady improvement)

**Why It Works**:
✓ Accurate visual representation
✓ Shows true magnitude of change
✓ Maintains perspective
✓ Honest communication

**Guideline**: "Bar charts and column charts should always start at zero. Line charts may not need zero if showing trends."

---

**Example 4: Limit Colors and Use Them Purposefully**

**❌ BEFORE: Rainbow Chart (BAD)**
```
Headcount by Role (12 colors)
[Pie chart with 12 different colored slices]
- Every slice a different color
- No color meaning
- Hard to match legend
- Visually overwhelming
```

**Problem**:
- Too many colors create confusion
- No semantic meaning to colors
- Difficult to match slices to legend
- Accessibility issues (colorblind)

**✅ AFTER: Strategic Color Use (GOOD)**
```
Headcount by Role

Technical Roles (60%)     ████████████░░ (Primary Blue)
Business Roles (30%)      ██████░░░░░░░░ (Medium Gray)
Support Roles (10%)       ██░░░░░░░░░░░░ (Medium Gray)

└─ Engineering:  45%      (Primary Blue)
└─ Product:      15%      (Light Blue)
```

**Why It Works**:
✓ Meaningful color grouping (Technical in blue)
✓ Only 2-3 colors used
✓ Easy to scan and understand
✓ Colorblind-friendly
✓ Professional appearance

**Guideline**: "Use color sparingly and purposefully. Limit to 3-4 colors. Use color to highlight, not decorate."

**Color Best Practices**:
- Primary Blue: Main data series
- Success Green: Positive trends, targets met
- Warning Yellow: Caution, attention needed
- Accent Orange: Alerts, negative trends
- Medium Gray: Secondary data, benchmarks

---

**Example 5: Provide Context and Benchmarks**

**❌ BEFORE: Number Without Context (BAD)**
```
┌──────────────────────┐
│   Time to Fill       │
│                      │
│      38 days         │
│                      │
└──────────────────────┘
```

**Problem**:
- No context: Is 38 days good or bad?
- No comparison point
- No trend information
- Requires audience to know benchmark

**✅ AFTER: Number With Context (GOOD)**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Time to Fill                       │
│                                      │
│   Current: 38 days ↓                │
│   vs. Last Quarter: 42 days          │
│   vs. Target: <40 days  ✓           │
│   vs. Industry: 45 days  ✓          │
│                                      │
│   [Mini trend chart: Q1-Q4]          │
│   └─ Improving trend                 │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why It Works**:
✓ Multiple comparison points
✓ Trend direction clear (↓)
✓ Target status visible
✓ Industry benchmark context
✓ Historical mini-chart

**Guideline**: "Always provide context: comparison to target, prior period, or benchmark."

---

**Example 6: Design for Accessibility**

**❌ BEFORE: Color-Only Differentiation (BAD)**
```
[Line chart with 3 lines]
- Red line
- Green line
- Blue line
(No other differentiation - colorblind users can't distinguish)
```

**Problem**:
- 8% of men are colorblind
- Color-only coding excludes users
- Doesn't work in black & white printing
- Fails accessibility standards

**✅ AFTER: Multi-Sensory Differentiation (GOOD)**
```
[Line chart with 3 lines]
- Solid line (───) + Circle markers (Primary Blue)
- Dashed line (---) + Square markers (Success Green)
- Dotted line (···) + Triangle markers (Accent Orange)
+ Clear legend with patterns
```

**Why It Works**:
✓ Works for colorblind users
✓ Prints clearly in black & white
✓ Multiple differentiation methods
✓ WCAG 2.1 compliant
✓ Clear for all audiences

**Guideline**: "Never rely on color alone. Use patterns, shapes, labels, and textures."

**Accessibility Checklist**:
- ✓ Color contrast ratio ≥4.5:1 for text
- ✓ Use patterns/shapes in addition to color
- ✓ Provide text alternatives for visuals
- ✓ Test with colorblind simulation tools
- ✓ Ensure keyboard navigation
- ✓ Use descriptive alt text

### Visual 13-Figure-13.4: Predictive Turnover Model Explanation

**Visual ID**: 13-Figure-13.4

**Type**: Process Diagram / ML Model Visualization

**Title**: Building a Predictive Employee Turnover Model

**Chapter Reference**: Chapter 13: Reporting and Analytics, Section "Predictive Turnover Modeling"

**Purpose**: Demystify predictive analytics by showing step-by-step how a machine learning model predicts employee turnover with transparent methodology.

**Content Description**:
- Six-step process from data collection through deployment
- Feature importance visualization
- Model accuracy metrics
- Practical application example
- Ethical considerations

**Six-Step Process**:

---

**Step 1: Data Collection** (Primary Blue)

**Data Sources**:
1. **HRIS Data**:
   - Tenure, role, level, department
   - Compensation, promotion history
   - Performance ratings
   - Manager changes

2. **Activity Data**:
   - Training completion
   - Internal job applications
   - Recognition received
   - PTO usage patterns

3. **Engagement Data**:
   - Survey responses
   - 1:1 meeting frequency
   - Participation in programs

4. **External Data**:
   - Local market conditions
   - Industry trends
   - Commute distance

**Sample Dataset**: 5,000 employees, 3 years of history, 650 actual departures

**Data Preparation**:
- Remove personally identifiable information (PII)
- Handle missing values
- Create feature variables
- Split into training (70%) and test (30%) sets

---

**Step 2: Feature Engineering** (Accent Orange)

**Feature Categories and Examples**:

| Category | Features | Why Predictive |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Tenure** | Months in role, company, with manager | High risk at 12-18 months and 3-5 years |
| **Compensation** | Compa-ratio, time since raise, relative to peers | Below-market compensation drives exits |
| **Performance** | Latest rating, trend, calibration changes | Both high and low performers at risk |
| **Engagement** | Survey scores, trend, change from prior | Declining engagement predicts turnover |
| **Career** | Months since promotion, promotion velocity | Stagnation increases flight risk |
| **Manager** | Manager tenure, team turnover rate | Manager quality impacts retention |
| **Activity** | Internal applications, training, recognition | Checking out behaviors |
| **Life Events** | Recent life changes (data permitting) | Relocation, family changes |

**Feature Engineering Examples**:
- "Months since last promotion": Current date - last promotion date
- "Pay percentile vs. peers": Rank(salary) within (role + level + location)
- "Engagement trend": Current score - prior survey score
- "Manager turnover rate": % of manager's team that left in last 12 months

**Total Features**: 45 variables engineered from raw data

---

**Step 3: Model Training** (Success Green)

**Algorithm Selection**:

Tried multiple algorithms:
1. Logistic Regression (baseline)
2. Random Forest ← **Selected**
3. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
4. Neural Network

**Why Random Forest?**
✓ High accuracy (85%)
✓ Handles non-linear relationships
✓ Provides feature importance
✓ Less prone to overfitting
✓ Interpretable

**Training Process**:
```
Training Data (3,500 employees)
    ↓
Split Features (X) and Target (Y)
X = 45 features
Y = Left (1) or Stayed (0)
    ↓
Train Random Forest Model
- 100 decision trees
- Max depth: 10
- Min samples per leaf: 20
    ↓
Cross-Validation (5-fold)
- Prevents overfitting
- Tests on different data splits
    ↓
Trained Model
```

---

**Step 4: Model Validation** (Accent Purple)

**Test on Unseen Data** (1,500 employees):

**Confusion Matrix**:
```
                  Predicted
                Stay    Leave
Actual  Stay    1,250    50     (True Negative, False Positive)
        Leave     150   50     (False Negative, True Positive)
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Accuracy**: 85% (1,300 correct / 1,500 total)
- **Precision**: 50% (50 / 100) - Of predicted leavers, 50% actually left
- **Recall**: 25% (50 / 200) - Of actual leavers, we predicted 25%
- **F1 Score**: 0.33 (balance of precision and recall)

**Interpretation**:
- Model is conservative (low recall)
- When it flags someone, 50% chance they'll leave (precision)
- Missing many actual leavers (75% false negatives)
- Trade-off: Avoid alert fatigue vs. catch all risks

**ROC Curve**: Area Under Curve (AUC) = 0.82 (good discrimination)

**Model Calibration**:
- Predicted probability 70% → Actually leaves ~70% of time
- Well-calibrated predictions

---

**Step 5: Feature Importance Analysis** (Primary Blue)

**Top 10 Most Important Features**:

```
Feature Importance (% contribution to prediction)

1. Engagement Score Trend        ████████████████░░ 18%
2. Months Since Last Promotion   ██████████████░░░░ 15%
3. Compa-Ratio                   ████████████░░░░░░ 12%
4. Manager Team Turnover Rate    ██████████░░░░░░░░ 10%
5. Internal Applications          ████████░░░░░░░░░░  9%
6. Performance Rating Trend      ███████░░░░░░░░░░░  8%
7. Time in Current Role          ██████░░░░░░░░░░░░  7%
8. Training Participation        █████░░░░░░░░░░░░░  6%
9. Recognition Received          ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  5%
10. PTO Usage Deviation          ███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  4%
```

**Insights**:
- **#1 Predictor**: Declining engagement (18% importance)
  * 3+ point drop in engagement = 4x turnover risk

- **#2 Predictor**: Promotion stagnation (15% importance)
  * 30+ months without promotion = 3x risk

- **#3 Predictor**: Compensation (12% importance)
  * Compa-ratio <0.90 = 2.5x risk

**Actionable Patterns**:
- Engagement decline + No promotion + Below market pay = 85% leave probability
- Recent promotion + High engagement = 5% leave probability
