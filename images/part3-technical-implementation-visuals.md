### Visual 11-Figure-11.3: Skills-Based Routing Integration

**Visual ID**: 11-Figure-11.3

**Type**: Process Diagram / Data Flow Diagram

**Title**: Skills-Based Incident Routing Using Integrated HR Competency Data

**Chapter Reference**: Chapter 11: ITSM Integration, Section "Service Desk Workforce Management"

**Purpose**: Illustrate how HR competency data integrates with ITSM platforms to enable intelligent, skills-based routing of incidents and requests.

**Content Description**:
- Data flow from HRIS to ITSM routing engine
- Real-time routing decision process
- Skills matching algorithm visualization
- Example incident routing scenario

**System Components**:

**1. HRIS/Competency System** (Left - Primary Blue)
- **Data Stored**:
  * Employee skills and certifications
  * Competency levels (1-5 scale)
  * Training completion status
  * Certifications and expiry dates
  * Language proficiencies
  * Technical specializations

Example employee record:
```
John Smith (ID: 12345)
├─ Windows Server: Expert (Level 5)
├─ Active Directory: Advanced (Level 4)
├─ Azure Cloud: Intermediate (Level 3)
├─ Python Scripting: Beginner (Level 2)
├─ Certifications:
│  ├─ Microsoft MCSA (Exp: 12/2025)
│  └─ ITIL Foundation v4 (Active)
├─ Languages: English (Native), Spanish (Intermediate)
└─ Current Availability: Available
```

**2. Integration Layer** (Center - Accent Orange)
- **Real-Time Data Sync**:
  * Skills updated in HRIS → Immediately synced to ITSM
  * Training completion → Auto-update skill levels
  * Certification expiry → Remove from routing pool
  * New hires → Auto-add to ITSM routing

- **Data Transformation**:
  * HR competency levels → ITSM skill tags
  * Org structure → Support groups
  * Job roles → Service categories
  * Availability status → Routing eligibility

**3. ITSM Routing Engine** (Right - Success Green)
- **Routing Logic**:
  1. Incident created
  2. Auto-categorize incident
  3. Identify required skills
  4. Query available agents with matching skills
  5. Prioritize by:
     - Skill level match
     - Current workload
     - Availability status
     - Historical performance
     - SLA urgency
  6. Auto-assign to best match

**Routing Example** (Bottom panel):

**Incident**: "User cannot access shared drive on Windows Server"

**Step 1: Categorize** (Automatic)
- Category: Infrastructure

### Visual 11-Figure-11.4: On-Call Rotation Management Integration

**Visual ID**: 11-Figure-11.4

**Type**: Calendar / Schedule Integration Diagram

**Title**: Integrated On-Call Rotation Management Across HRIS and ITSM

**Chapter Reference**: Chapter 11: ITSM Integration, Section "Incident Management Integration"

**Purpose**: Show how on-call schedules managed in HR systems sync with ITSM for automated escalation, work hour tracking, and compensation management.

**Content Description**:
- Unified calendar view showing on-call schedule
- Data synchronization between HRIS and ITSM
- Automated workflows triggered by schedule
- On-call compensation tracking

**Main Calendar View** (Center):
- Monthly calendar grid (4 weeks shown)
- Color-coded on-call assignments
- Multiple rotation tiers (Primary, Secondary, Backup)
- Holiday and PTO indicators
- Integration points highlighted

Week view example:

```
                MON      TUE      WED      THU      FRI      SAT      SUN
Primary:       Sarah L.  Sarah L.  John S.  John S.  John S.  Mike C.  Mike C.
Secondary:     John S.   John S.   Mike C.  Mike C.  Sarah L. Sarah L. John S.
Backup:        Mike C.   Amy T.    Amy T.   Sarah L. Amy T.   John S.  Sarah L.
```

**HRIS System** (Left panel - Primary Blue):

**Manages**:

- Fairness and equity monitoring

**Data Synced to ITSM**:
- Current on-call person (real-time)
- Escalation order (primary → secondary → backup)
- Contact information (phone, alternate contacts)
- Schedule changes (immediate notification)
- PTO/unavailability blocking

**Workflow Examples**:

1. **Schedule Creation** (in HRIS):
   - HR/Manager creates rotation schedule
   - System checks for conflicts (PTO, other commitments)
   - Auto-sync to ITSM within 5 minutes
   - Email notification to on-call staff

2. **PTO Request Impact**:
   - Employee requests PTO during on-call shift
   - System flags conflict
   - Manager reassigns on-call duty
   - ITSM escalation rules updated automatically

3. **On-Call Hours Tracking**:
   - ITSM logs on-call incidents (time, duration)
   - Data syncs to HRIS time tracking
   - Automatic compensation calculation
   - Included in payroll

---

**ITSM Platform** (Right panel - Success Green):

**Manages**:
- Incident escalation
- Alert notifications
- On-call paging
- Response time tracking
- Incident logging

**Data Received from HRIS**:
- Current on-call roster (real-time)
- Escalation chain
- Contact methods
- Availability status

**Automated Actions**:

1. **Incident Escalation**:
```
P1 Incident Created
     ↓
Alert Primary On-Call (from HRIS schedule)
     ↓
No Response in 5 Minutes?
     ↓
Escalate to Secondary On-Call
     ↓
No Response in 5 Minutes?
     ↓
Escalate to Backup + Manager
```

2. **After-Hours Incident**:
   - Incident logged in ITSM (timestamp: 2:30 AM)
   - On-call person notified (from HRIS schedule)
   - Incident resolved (timestamp: 3:15 AM)
   - **Auto-sync to HRIS**:
     * Work hours: 2:30 AM - 3:15 AM (45 minutes)
     * Classification: After-hours on-call
     * Compensation: 1.5x overtime + on-call premium
     * Time-off accrual: 45 minutes comp time
