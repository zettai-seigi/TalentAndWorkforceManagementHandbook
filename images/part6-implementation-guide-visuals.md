**Column 1: Strategic Pitfalls**
1. **Technology-First Approach**: Buying system before defining requirements
   - Warning sign icon
   - Impact: 60% project failure rate
   - Root cause: "We need an HRIS" vs. "We need to solve X problem"

2. **No Executive Sponsorship**: Project owned only by HR
   - Impact: 75% fail to meet objectives
   - Root cause: Seen as HR project, not business priority

3. **Unclear Success Metrics**: "Better processes" without measurement
   - Impact: Unable to demonstrate value
   - Root cause: Starting without defining success

4. **Scope Creep**: Expanding requirements during implementation
   - Impact: 40% budget overrun, delays
   - Root cause: Poor scope management, saying yes to everything

5. **Underestimating Change Management**: 5-10% of budget vs. needed 20-30%
   - Impact: Low adoption, wasted investment
   - Root cause: Assuming "if we build it, they will come"

**Column 2: Execution Pitfalls**
6. **Boiling the Ocean**: Trying to fix everything at once
7. **No Pilot Program**: Full deployment without testing
8. **Over-Customization**: Customizing technology beyond necessity
9. **Ignoring Data Quality**: Analytics on dirty data
10. **Training as Afterthought**: Training only at launch, not ongoing

**Column 3: Organizational Pitfalls**
11. **HR-Only Team**: No business representation in design
12. **Perfection Paralysis**: Waiting for perfect solution
13. **Ignoring Resistance**: Hoping resistance will fade
14. **Poor Communication**: Infrequent, one-way, corporate-speak
